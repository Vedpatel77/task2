      "description2": "What helps start a hard meeting on a positive note? How do you encourage team members to think bigger?The answer: icebreakers. Or should I say, the answer is still icebreakers? Last year I wrote an article about the power of this misunderstood tool to impact group attitudes and outcomes, and I was not prepared for the response.

I mean, let’s face it, icebreakers get a bad wrap for being corny, fluffy and old school. But after the overwhelming response I received last year, I feel pretty confident in saying that this is a tool people actually want to use! Now that we’re reprograming how we think about icebreakers, I thought I’d share a few more scenarios in which they’re particularly helpful. Feel free to copy and paste them into your next session!",
